In this project we perform interactive Exploratory data analysis
on Amazon Reviews data to extract meaningful information from 
data. Then apply some machine learning algorithms on data to
predict the score given by user.

we use the following ML algorithms :

1. LogisticRegression
2. RandomForestClassifier
3. MultinomialNB
4. GaussianNB
5. SVC
